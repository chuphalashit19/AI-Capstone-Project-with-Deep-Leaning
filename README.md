# AI-Capstone-Project-with-Deep-Leaning

Developing pre-trained model using ResNet18 along with PyTorch .
Finding accuracy and plotting graph for the loss function.
We use the Positive and Negative Tensor files to train our model.
We make use of Tensors files to make the compiling faster as it contains huge data.
Also we find the four misclassified samples in the model
